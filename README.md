## üëã Welcome to my head ‚Äì uh, I mean, my profile!

**Between madness and websites** ‚Äì that‚Äôs where my everyday life happens.
For me, programming isn‚Äôt just a hobby or a job ‚Äì
it‚Äôs my personal way of coping with an **overactive brain** and my **PTSD/PTBS**.
üß†üíª

### üí¨ Why I code

In my world, a clean HTML document can sometimes replace a therapy session,
and a well-placed margin can bring more order to my life than most calendars.
I write **HTML**, tinker with **PHP**, style with **CSS** ‚Äì and experience the full spectrum of human emotions:
from euphoria to existential crises over a missing semicolon.

### üîÑ Between success and exceptions

I work on web projects from time to time ‚Äì some run surprisingly smoothly,
others spontaneously choose a free fall into madness.
What works well gets celebrated.
What crashes ends up honestly documented on **GitHub** ‚Äì including error messages, debug notes, and sometimes even a small meltdown.

### üí° My digital self-help program

This is more than just a code archive.
It‚Äôs a place of **semicolon-driven self-discovery**,
a creative survival strategy with style, humor, and a shot of black coffee.

üôè Glad you‚Äôre here. Take a look around. Maybe you‚Äôll find something between the lines that inspires you ‚Äì or at least makes you smile.
