## 👋 Welcome to my head – uh, I mean, my profile!

**Between madness and websites** – that’s where my everyday life happens.
For me, programming isn’t just a hobby or a job –
it’s my personal way of coping with an **overactive brain** and my **PTSD/PTBS**.

### 💬 Why I code

In my world, a clean HTML document can sometimes replace a therapy session,
and a well-placed margin can bring more order to my life than most calendars.
I write **HTML**, tinker with **PHP**, style with **CSS** – and experience the full spectrum of human emotions:
from euphoria to existential crises over a missing semicolon.

### 🔄 Between success and exceptions

I work on web projects from time to time – some run surprisingly smoothly,
others spontaneously choose a free fall into madness.
What works well gets celebrated.
What crashes ends up honestly documented on **GitHub** – including error messages, debug notes, and sometimes even a small meltdown.

### 💡 My digital self-help program

This is more than just a code archive.
It’s a place of **semicolon-driven self-discovery**,
a creative survival strategy with style, humor, and a shot of black coffee.

🙏 Glad you’re here. Take a look around. Maybe you’ll find something between the lines that inspires you – or at least makes you smile.
